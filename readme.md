`yadloom` script is a Python program that launches the GZDoom game engine with a specified configuration profile. It allows the user to define multiple profiles, each with its own set of options, and easily switch between them.

Requirements:

- Python 3.6 or later
- GZDoom game engine

## Usage:

```bash
yadloom PROFILENAME [GZDOOM_ARGS]
```

- `PROFILENAME`: The name of the configuration profile to use.
- `GZDOOM_ARGS`: Additional command-line arguments to pass to GZDoom.

## Configuration:
The script expects a configuration file located at `~/.yadloom.json`. The configuration file should be in JSON format and contain the following keys:

- `.wadDir`: The directory where the game WAD files are located.
- `.profiles`: A dictionary of configuration profiles, where each profile is defined as a key-value pair. The key is the name of the profile, and the value is a dictionary of options to be passed to GZDoom. The options should be specified as key-value pairs, where the key is the option name and the value is the option value. WAD files can be specified  `file` option, which can be either a single file or a list of files. Lists of files can also be defined using variables, which are specified using the syntax `$VARIABLE_NAME`, where `VARIABLE_NAME` is the name of the variable defined in the `.wadLists` property. 
- `.wadLists` : A named set of wads that can be referenced by a profile. The `wadList` value should be a list of file names.

Example configuration file:

```json
{
    "wadDir": "~/games/doom",
    "profiles": {
        "default": {
            "iwad": "doom2.wad",
            "file": ["mods/mymod.wad", "maps/map01.wad"],
            "skill": "3"
        },
        "vanilla": {
            "iwad": "doom.wad",
            "file": ["doom1.wad", "doomu.wad"],
            "skill": "4"
        },
        "custom": {
            "iwad": "doom2.wad",
            "file": ["$EXTRA_WADS"],
            "skill": "5"
        }
    },
    "wadLists": {
        "MODS": ["mods/mymod.wad", "mods/mymod2.wad"],
        "EXTRA_WADS": ["extra/map01.wad", "extra/map02.wad"]
    }
}
```

Functionality:

1. Parses the configuration file and stores the values in a dictionary.
2. Resolves the WAD files and stores the resolved values in the configuration dictionary.
3. Parses the specified profile and generates a command-line string from the profile options.
4. Executes GZDoom with the generated command-line string and any additional arguments specified by the user.
